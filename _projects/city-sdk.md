This project was launched in response to the [City SDK Challenge](http://hackforchange.org/challenges/citysdk/) from Code for America's _Hack For Change_ initiative. Our goal is to develop an open-source web application to allow local leaders, agencies, and citizens to easily cross-examine data from federal, state, county, and city sources. One example we built was a tool to compare the locations of farmer's markets against the average household income of various regions in the Tucson metro area, illustrating potential food deserts.
