Code for Tucson invites **you** to the National Day of Civic Hacking! Thousands of people from across the United States will come together to build using publicly-released data, technology, and design processes to improve our communities and the governments that serve them. Anyone can participate; you donâ€™t have to be an expert in technology, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
